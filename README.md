# Text_Summarizer
A text summarizer that extracts important sentences based on noun-pronoun distance relationship. Uses pos tagging and tree structure for lexical analysis. 

Text summarization can broadly be divided into two categories â€” Extractive Summarization and Abstractive Summarization. 
This project is based on extractive summarization where in important sentences are extracted to form a summary.(Does not generate an entire new summary)

Importance of a sentence is measured by lexical analysis and by measuring noun-pronoun relationship and thier distances. 
* Preprocess the text i.e to remove stopwords, stemming and lemmatizing.
* Identify which words are nouns and pronouns.
* Forming an lexical tree to distinguish person, object, group and so on.
* Finding relation between nouns and pronouns to Assign nouns to each of the pronouns to which it referred to.
* whichever noun-pronoun pair has less distance and occur frequently in a sentence is considered as an important sentence.
  (The same can be implemented for noun-verb, noun-preposition relationship and so on.)

Nlp involves iterating the text many times. To avoid it as much as possible it is programmed using many dictionaries.
